  after the dot-com business went bust
  The project was inspired when I was looking for the word for wine. After returning from California where I had fallen in love with Napa Valley, I wanted to make wine from the wild berries of Ireland which I had done with my father many years previous.
  Since it was winter time and there were no berries on the trees I decided to create a label for the wine bottles and give it a name... the Irish word for wine, which I could not remember what it was even though I had been fluent in Irish after spending many summers in the Gaeltacts of Donegal.
  So that evening I bought the domain englishirishdictionary.com, emailed all the lists I found online, told them I was building a searchable database of irish terms, and if they would permit me to add their words to the database
  I spend the next 2 years typing words I found on the Internet into the database along with usage examples of thse words. Shortly after completing the dictionary I realized that understanding the tenses of the verbs was a big part of any language.
